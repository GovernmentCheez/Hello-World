# Hello-World
Treasure Trove!
   For the past 15 years I have been fascinated with computers. In the beginning, I was like most users. I would search the net and find interesting, funny videos and blogs and fight off boredom. Being a novice comedian and very opionated person, I thought, I would like to throw my hat in the ring and see if I can spark interest in what I had to say.

   Now there are many ways to get yourself out there on the net. I joined forums and IRC channels and enjoyed meeting people from all over the world and getting to know them, but I desired something more concrete. I wanted a place of my own on the world wide web, a place to leave my mark. I decided to build a website and blog about my life there.

   As I am sure most people do, I joined a free website host. The account came with a website builder, which made it easy to throw up pages quickly and effortlessly by dragging and dropping content. I was off and running, in no time at all I created A very basic website. I decided to browse some other sites and see how mine stacked up.

   These other sites looked and functioned so much better than mine and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't create what I had envisioned my site to be. After a lot of research, I decided that in order to do what I wanted, I was going to have to learn to use HTML and CSS coding. Through my research I stumbled across a site called www.boogiejack.com.

   Boogiejack, aka Dennis Gaskill, offered free tutorials and even graphics he had made free just for signing up as a member of his site. I owe every bit of my basic coding knowledge to this gentleman and his site. I created a visually beautiful and fully functional website using code that I learned. Coding allowed me the freedom to place content wherever I liked and I was hooked.

   Coding was amazing to me. To be able to take a simple text file and turn it into something special, created exactly how you pictured it was so interesting. Sure it takes time, but the payoff is well worth the effort especially when you consider it was all YOU.

   My first site is now long gone. Lost out there in the abyss, because my host shut down and took my content with it. Today I work on websited using HTML5, CSS3, JS, Bootstrap, WordPress and many other methods. The point is, the internet is a treasure trove of extremely valuable, available and free information. There is absolutely nothing that can't be researched and learned out there.

   There are so many tools available now it's astonishing. I am now working on learning coding to build applications and software. One day I hope to use it to give back to the online community and the world.
